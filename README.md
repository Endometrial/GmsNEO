# Baphomet
A simple C game engine with features heavily informed by GMS2

Depends:
GLFW
glad
libpng
cglm
portaudio

Issues:
* Improve styling & predicatability of function names 
* Populate room.c
* Add support for loading .wav somehow
* Integrate a coordinate system
* Figure out how to load fn ptrs from mutiple 'objects' (libjit?)
