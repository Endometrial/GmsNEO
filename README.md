# Baphomet
A simple C game engine with features heavily informed by GMS2

Depends:
GLFW
cglm
portaudio
libxml2
libpng
libogg
libvorbis

Issues:
* Improve styling & predicatability of function names generally 
* Add support for loading .ogg (vorbis) via portaudio
* Add support for loading backgrounds with rooms
* Add support for loading additions to objects with rooms
* Add support for additions to object scripts @ runtime (ex setting variables)
* Consider -- but then ultimately decide not too -- create a gui for room creation
